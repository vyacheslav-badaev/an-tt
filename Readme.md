#####**Tip #2 - Use plugins to become more efficient**
1. [KeyPromoter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4455)
	The plugin basically will annoy the hell out of you by showing you a big screen overlay with the key combination you should have used , if you used your mouse to execute some command to a level when you basically would start using the key combination just to avoid KeyPromoter annoying you all the time. 
	Its also is usefull features, like it will prompt you to create a key binding for a command which does not have a key binding and you have used it 3 times.
1. [String Manipulation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162)
2. [Lines Sorter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5919)
#####**Tip #3 - Use the Darcula Theme in Android Studio**
Ok, I know its more like a preference , but trust me using that keeps your eyes less strained as they would be if you used the Default Light theme.
#####**Tip #4 - Don't use a small font**
Preferably use a font in Android Studio thats easy to read and is at a font size which doesnot forces you to strain your eyes.
I use Menlo font.
#####**Tip #5 - Use a code style**
You should use a standard codestyle 
 So possible contenders can be
+ [AOSP Codestyle](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
+ [Square IntelliJ Codestyle](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles)
####***Emulator***
Apart from using physical devices , one should use emulators as they are as of now easy to manage and equivalently powerful.

+ [Intel Emulator bundled in SDK Manger](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html)

###***Make better choices while coding***
#### **Tip #1 - Use OkHttp over HttpUrlConnect**
HttpUrlConnect suffers from [quite some bugs](https://android-developers.blogspot.in/2011/09/androids-http-clients.html). 
[Okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) solves them in a more elegant manner. [[Ref]](https://corner.squareup.com/2013/05/announcing-okhttp.html)
#### **Tip #2 - Use [Pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat) for logging**
#### **Tip #3 - Use the [Embedded Terminal inside Android Studio](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/working-with-embedded-local-terminal.html)**
#### **Tip #4 - Use git**
#### **Tip #5 - Use [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark)**
Its a standalone tool for Android Devs used to browse any Android executable and show important info such as class interfaces and members, dex counts and dependencies
#### **Tip #5 - Use [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark)**

###***Other Resources***
#### **Tip #1 - Listen to podcasts**
1. [Fragmented](http://fragmentedpodcast.com/)
2. [Android Developers Backstage](https://androidbackstage.blogspot.in/)
P.S : I use [Player.fm](https://player.fm/) to listen to these podcasts. They even have an [Android Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.player&hl=en) , all for FREE.
#### **Tip #2 - Checkout new android libraries**
