Cheatsheet about tips and tricks for Android Development
This is a simple set of tips and tricks regarding Android Development which I have gathered from various sources. It helps me direct other android devs in my community regarding stuff each android dev should know about. Its also there for me to keep track of anything I either learn on my own or from other sources now and then when browsing the internet.
Contributions are always welcome, hoping people will help me in growing this. To contribute, simply open up a PR with the changes.
###***Know Your Tools***
####***Android Studio***
+ **Code faster by using keyboard shortcuts**
  |Description|Mac|Linux/Win

  |Refactor This|`Ctrl`+`T`|`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`T`
  |Stop Process|`Cmd`+`F2`|`Ctrl`+`F2`
+ **Use plugins to become more efficient**
  1. [KeyPromoter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/4455)
    The plugin basically will annoy the hell out of you by showing you a big screen overlay with the key combination you should have used , if you used your mouse to execute some command to a level when you basically would start using the key combination just to avoid KeyPromoter annoying you all the time. 
    Its also is useful features, like it will prompt you to create a key binding for a command which does not have a key binding and you have used it 3 times.
  1. [String Manipulation](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/2162)
  1. [Lines Sorter](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/5919)
  1. [Findbugs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/3847?pr=idea) 
  1. [Sonar Lint](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7973) 
  1. [Checkstyles](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065) 
+ **Use the Darcula Theme in Android Studio**
Ok, I know its more like a preference , but trust me using that keeps your eyes less strained as they would be if you used the Default Light theme.
+ **Don't use a small font**
Preferably use a font in Android Studio thats easy to read and is at a font size which doesnot forces you to strain your eyes.
I use [Menlo font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)).
+ **Use a code style**
You should use a standard codestyle 
 So possible contenders can be
  + [AOSP Codestyle](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
  + [Square IntelliJ Codestyle](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles)
+ **Use the [Embedded Terminal inside Android Studio](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.2/working-with-embedded-local-terminal.html)**
+ **Use the Memory/Network/CPU Monitor inside Android Studio to profile your code/app**
####***Emulator***
Apart from using physical devices , one should use emulators as they are as of now easy to manage and equivalently powerful.
+ [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/)
+ [Intel Emulator bundled in SDK Manger](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html)
####***[Vysor](http://www.vysor.io/)***
This one needs special mention due to how useful it is. It basically is a window to your device i.e it streams and allows you to interact with your physical device on your laptop. Very useful when you are demo-ing your app during a presentation. You can interact with your physical device and it will be shown right in your laptop screen. It has a paid/free version , paid version is totally worth buying.

###***Make better choices while coding***
+ **Use OkHttp over HttpUrlConnect**
HttpUrlConnect suffers from [quite some bugs](https://android-developers.blogspot.in/2011/09/androids-http-clients.html). 
[Okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) solves them in a more elegant manner. 
[[Reference Link]](https://corner.squareup.com/2013/05/announcing-okhttp.html)
+ **Use [Pidcat](https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat) for logging**
+ **Use some Version Control System(VCS) like [Git](https://git-scm.com/)**
+ **Use [ClassyShark](https://github.com/google/android-classyshark)**
Its a standalone tool for Android Devs used to browse any Android executable and show important info such as class interfaces and members, dex counts and dependencies
+ **Use [Stetho](https://github.com/facebook/stetho)**
Debug your android apps using Chrome Dev Tools.
+ **Use [Battery Historian](https://github.com/google/battery-historian)**
A tool to analyze battery consumers using Android "bugreport" files.
+ **Always use a constant version value like "24.1.1"**
  Avoid using `+` when specifying the version of dependencies.
  + Keeps one secured from unexpected API changes in the dependency.
  + Avoids doing an extra network call for the checking latest version of each dependency on every build.
+ **Use [Handler instead of a TimerTask](http://www.mopri.de/2010/timertask-bad-do-it-the-android-way-use-a-handler/)**
+ **[Do not use your own personal email for Google Play Developer Account](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2hywu9/google_play_only_one_strike_is_needed_to_ruin_you/)**
+ **Use Vectors instead of PNG**
  If you do **have** to use png, compress them. Take a look at [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com).
+ **Use proguard**
  ```gradle
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
  ```
+ **Use shrinkResources**
  ```gradle
  android {
    ...
    buildTypes {
        release {
            shrinkResources true
            minifyEnabled true
            ...
        }
    }
}
  ```
+ **[Simulating Android killing your app in the background](https://twitter.com/Jahnold/status/759775495655333888),  run in terminal**
  `adb shell am kill`
+ **Follow the below [rule to have faster gradle builds](https://medium.com/@skaliakoudas/decreasing-build-times-by-decreasing-gradle-memory-requirements-7fcafc6d98ea#.otnm0ofb6)**
  `Gradle memory >= Dex memory + 1Gb`
+ **Split your apk using gradle when using Native code, do not bundle all of em together and ship!.. coz that will make you evil**
  ```gradle
  defaultConfig {
      ...
      ndk {
        abiFilters "armeabi", "armeabi-v7a", "mips", "x86"
      }
    }
  //Split into platform dependent APK
    splits {
      abi {
        enable true
        reset()
        include 'armeabi', 'armeabi-v7a', 'mips', 'x86' //select ABIs to build APKs for
        universalApk false //generate an additional APK that contains all the ABIs
      }
    }
    // map for the version code
    project.ext.versionCodes = ['armeabi': 1, 'armeabi-v7a': 2, 'mips': 5, 'x86': 8]
    // Rename with proper versioning
    android.applicationVariants.all { variant ->
      // assign different version code for each output
      variant.outputs.each { output ->
        output.versionCodeOverride =
            project.ext.versionCodes.get(output.getFilter(com.android.build.OutputFile.ABI), 0) *
                1000000 +
                android.defaultConfig.versionCode
      }
    }
  ```
+ **Learn about some architecture such as MVP or Clean**
+ **Try to understand and follow TDD (Test Driven Development)**
+ **Follow the DRY principle**
DRY = Do not Repeat Yourself
+ **[Package by Feature, not layers](https://medium.com/the-engineering-team/package-by-features-not-layers-2d076df1964d)**
+ **[Learn about Dependency Resolution](http://crushingcode.co/the-curious-case-of-dependency-conflicts/)** 
  With the speed android dependencies update, sooner or later you are going to encounter some sort of dependency conflict. Solution is making use of Dependency Resoultion. [Official Reference](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html)

####Credits
Some of the tips and tricks are something I have been following in my workflow and some of them have been from various other sources.
I have tried to add direct links  wherever I could remember, giving people due credit who have explained the concepts. If  you think I have missed any , then either send a PR or open an issue and I will fix it asap.
